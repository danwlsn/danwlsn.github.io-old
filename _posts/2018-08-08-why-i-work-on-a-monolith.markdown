I've recently landed the biggest step in my career. A job as a software engineer at co-op digital. I've had other web developer jobs in the past and dabled with side projects, but this is what I would call 'The Real Deal'. The job was to work on a project that is far larger than anything I've worked on before. 

I consider myself at the beginning of my journey to becoming a software engineer, and I've definitely got a long way to go. In the book 'The Art of Leanring' by chess master and push hands world champ Josh Waitzkin he talks about leaning things from the outside in. He talks about when he was first leanring chess. He's teacher would work from the end game (pawn and king vs king) and then work backwards from there. Adding more pieces as he masters the end game. The first thing most people learn in chess is openings, but that was the last thing Josh focussed on.

With my career I've been focussing on the same things over and over again. While chess may have so many different openings, starting a web project is usually the same. You only ever get to see so many moving parts per project (Caveat; I have been working on fairly small projects for the most part). And seeing as most early stage projects are just CRUD apps, you're just going to get very good at setting these sort of apps up. 

Instead, you start from outside in. Starting with the monolith and seeing all the moving parts that it has. Once you understand how all these moving parts of a monolith fit together, or how you could make them better, you can architect your small application better to avoide headaches later down the line. Or maybe your application deals with something that isn't just CRUD. You've seen this part before on a monolith.
