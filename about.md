Hi there. My name is Danny Wilson and I'm a Software Engineer from Manchester. I'm currently working for Co-op digital
and building HALA on the side. 

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on the internet. I share on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/danwlsn). I put most of my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/danwlsn). You can see what I'm seeing on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/danwlsnn). And listen to what I'm listening to on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/3fklxwqjac5h4rexififydfk1?si=u05q0bfPTFC2vJ0DZJhwbA). Or you could just <a href="mailto:danwlsn@posteo.net">email me</a>. Or if you're paranoid about the NSA, you can find my [public key](https://keybase.io/wilson) on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io).
